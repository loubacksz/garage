What is EAG?
- generates an Express application "skeleton" that follows the mvc pattern

- globally installed with -g flag
  - using the 'npm install express-generator -g'
  - followed by 'express app_name' command to generate an app
- or using 'npx express-generator app_name'

- when using EAG remember to always change the 'var' variables declarations to 'const' or 'let'

- I can start the app by simply running 'npm start'
  - but if I use a CMD/WSL/POWERSHELL command that creates an env var, I'll enable debugging/loggin
  - that's because EAG apps use the DEBUG module
  - ex: SET DEBUG=express-locallibrary-tutorial:* & npm start
